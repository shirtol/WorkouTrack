## Description

During the COVID pandemic and the quarantines, sitting all day and doing nothing made this period harder. So I started working out with YouTube playlists. Everyday in the evening I created a playlist for the next morning, with some videos I liked, and I keep going with this routine until now.

In this project I created a website that lets you create your own workout schedule and bind playlists you created to it. You can watch these playlists either directly from the playlist section or from the workout schedule your created, as well as the main screen which shows your daily workout.

In the home page you can also see your progress, with a line chart that shows how many workout you did every month in the current year.
